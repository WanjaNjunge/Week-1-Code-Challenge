# Week-1-Code-Challenge

This repository contains solutions to JavaScript code challenges.
Each challenge is a standalone script that can be run independently.

# Challenge 1: Student Grades
student-grades.js prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100, and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:

1. A > 79
2. B > 60 to 79
3. C > 59 to 49
4. D > 40 to 49
5. E > less 40

# Challenge 2: Speeding Demerits
speeding-demerits.js takes as input the speed of a car and calculates the number of demerit points the driver receives based on the following criteria:

1. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok".
2. Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.
3. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function prints "License suspended".

# Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
This is a JavaScript program that calculates the deductions and net salary of an employee based on their basic salary and benefits. The program uses the tax rates for Payee Tax, NHIF, and NSSF provided by Aren Payroll and the calculation formulae for Payee Tax provided by the Kenya Revenue Authority.

Note that this program is designed to calculate the deductions and net salary of an employee in Kenya, based on the current tax rates and formulae as of September 2021. It may not be accurate for other countries or for future dates when the tax rates and formulae may change. Use at your own risk.

# Usage
To run each script, simply open the file in your JavaScript editor of choice and run the script. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the code into your browser console or a tool like repl.it.

Use the following code for the respective scripts:
1. node student-grades.js
2. node speeding-demerits.js 
3. node net-salary.js
